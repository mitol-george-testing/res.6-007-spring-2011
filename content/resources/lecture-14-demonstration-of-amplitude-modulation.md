**Topics covered:** Demonstration: time-domain and frequency-domain signals with signal generator, oscilloscope, and spectrum analyzer; Demonstration: time and frequency scaling with musical tones; Demonstration: amplitude modulation with sinusoidal, triangular, and square-wave carrier signals; Demonstration: effect of changing the percent of modulation in both time and frequency domains; Demonstration: amplitude modulation signals in an AM radio receiver.

**Instructors:** Prof. Alan V. Oppenheim; Prof. Sandy Hill
