**Topics covered:** Conversion of continuous-time to discrete-time signals through sampling; Digital differentiaion, half-sample delay; Demonstration: sampling a continuous-time signal, filtering sequences with a low-pass filter, reconstructing a continuous-time signal using bandlimited interpolation.

**Instructor:** Prof. Alan V. Oppenheim
