**Topics covered:** Response of continuous-time LTI systems to complex exponentials: the eigenfunction property; Representation of periodic signals as linear combinations of harmonically related complex exponentials; Fourier series for continuous time: the analysis and synthesis equations; Example: symmetric and anti-symmetric periodic square wave; Approximation of periodic signals; Fourier series convergence.

**Instructor:** Prof. Alan V. Oppenheim
