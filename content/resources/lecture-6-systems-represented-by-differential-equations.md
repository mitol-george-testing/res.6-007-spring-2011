**Topics covered:** First-order differential and difference equations; Solution as a sum of particular and homogeneous terms; Auxiliary conditions and relation to system linearity, causality, and time-invariance; Block-diagram representations of LTI systems described by difference equations and differential equations using adders, coefficient multipliers, and delay elements (discrete-time) or integrators (continuous-time).

**Instructor:** Prof. Alan V. Oppenheim
